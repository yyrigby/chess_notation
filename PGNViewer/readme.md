## Summary

PgnViewerJS allows to display chess games in various ways. The distribution (where this readme is a part of)
contains all necessary files to integrate the viewer into your web application. To demonstrate the usage,
the files  in the directory `examples` are included as well. So for a start, you may use the four examples
to see the difference in the four modes:

* Board: Just display a chess board
* View: Allow to view a chess game, play the moves
* Print: Gives a print representation with multiple boards in it, but no interactive view
* Edit: A variant to `View` that even allows to adapt the games (not finished yet).
